# Overhear

Overhear is a macOS menu bar app that makes your meetings effortless.

- **MVP:** Meeter-style menu bar launcher for calendar meetings.
- **Phase 1:** Granola-style live transcription + subtitle mode.
- **Phase 2:** Speaker labels, summaries, and action items.
- **Phase 3:** Local noise cancellation.
- **Phase 4:** Integrations (GitHub, Notion, Confluence, etc).

All processing is **local-first** and privacy-conscious.
